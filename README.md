# ECE285_selfie2anime

Course project for ECE 285 Intro to Visual Learning @ UCSD by Prof. Xiaolong Wang.

We have implemented a CycleGAN model to train on the Selfie2Anime dataset. The goal is to convert human selfies into anime-style faces.

If you want to use the model on your own images, there is a demo in Explore.ipynb
